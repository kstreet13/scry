Title: Small-Count Analysis Methods for High-Dimensional Data
Version: 1.1.2
Description: Many modern biological datasets consist of small counts that are 
            not well fit by standard linear-Gaussian methods such as principal
            component analysis. This package provides implementations of 
            count-based feature selection and dimension reduction algorithms.
            These methods can be used to facilitate unsupervised analysis
            of any high-dimensional data such as single-cell RNA-seq.
